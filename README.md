# OverView of the Challenge:
This challenge is about NASA's Mission to Mars and we were suppose to learn web scraping methods to extract information from the NASA"s website using Chrome Developer tools to scrape data using HTML components and Beautiful Soup/Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scrape, MongoDB to store the data, and Flask. There were two deliverables. In the first deliverable following information was required to get through web scrapping using Mars NASA News site:
* Scrape Title 
* Preview Text From Mars News
In order to get this data first import Splinter and BeautifulSoup and then execute the path and url,store the scraping results in Python data structures, store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary, store all the dictionaries in a Python list and print the list in notebook.
 In Delivearable Two we were required to:
 Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data:
 In order to scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data we use Mars Temperature Data site. Then create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.
 Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame and answer the following questions:
 
Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
